I went for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade.

I wasn't sure what to do about the color of the "Choose State" text in the select menu. I wasn't sure if all text was supposed to be that color once it was typed or if the Choose State was a placeholder. I tried changing the color of just that specific option but I couldn't get it to work. I tried selecting option[disabled], which selected the item inside of the list and not the one on the form. I decided to just leave the text the same color as the other items. 

One of the requirements was to change the background-color of a main section. I did the header. I origininally changed the background color of the form but I thought it looked horrible so I changed it to the header.
